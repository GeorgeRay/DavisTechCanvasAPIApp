# DTC Canvas API App
This applicaiton is designed to work as a helpmate to the Instructure Canvas Web Applicaton.

## Motivation
This app was designed for the faculty at the Davis Technical College to help them work with Canvas more efficently. Some features are very specific to the Davis Tech teaching environment.

## Installation
Make sure you can run Visual Studio on your computer. Visual Studio Code will not work great with DavisTechCanvasAPIApp. 

## Usage
The first time opening the application, a settings form will automatically prompt you for your Canvas URL (for example, "https://schoolname.instructure.com/") and your access token. Access tokens can be generated on Canvas at instructure.com/profile (for example, "https://schoolname.instructure.com/profile"). You know you have configured the API token and website correctly when your name appears in the window.
